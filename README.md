# LastSurvivor

This is a game made for the 100DaysOfCode Challenge. It is nothing special but I had a lot of fun doing it and learned a lot.
This is a top-down shooter game where the goal is to survive the zombie demons and the BIG demons for as long as possible and kill as many of those creatures to get a higher score.

It is made in Java and I commented it for anyone who wants to take a look at the Source Code to be easier to read. Take a look at it if you want and tell me what I should improve in the code (there is a lot I know it already). 
Also tell me what you think that I could add to the game in the future.

PS: There is a Mouse.java class int the source, it is not working for now, I just left it there because I didn't want to lose that piece of code if in the future I'd want to add it to the project.
